Yes, Student B will need to make minimal additions to your current files. Here's exactly what and where they need to add code, with guidance:

the communication.rs module is needed to be done by you and then do the following to add it to our current program in the following manner

✅ 1. main.rs
📍 Where: Top of the file
Add this line to import the communication module:

rust
Copy code
mod communication; // NEW
use communication::simulate_communication;
📍 Where: Inside the scheduled_tasks list
Near your existing ScheduledTask::new(...) entries, add this one:

rust
Copy code
ScheduledTask::new(
    "Communication",
    500, // Adjust as needed (e.g., every 500ms)
    TaskPriority::Low,
    Box::new(|| Box::pin(async {
        simulate_communication();
        tokio::time::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(80)).await;
    })),
),
✅ 2. task_scheduler.rs
No changes needed here. The existing scheduling infrastructure supports the communication task as-is.

✅ 3. New File: communication.rs
Student B should create this new file in src/ to keep their logic separate:

rust
Copy code
// src/communication.rs

pub fn simulate_communication() {
    println!("↪ [Comm] Handling satellite communication...");
    // TODO: Add command parsing, sending acknowledgments, etc.
}
✅ Summary of Where to Add Code

main.rs->Top of file->mod communication; and use communication::*
main.rs->Inside scheduled_tasks vector->Add "Communication" task using ScheduledTask::new
src/ directory->Create communication.rs->Define simulate_communication() function
